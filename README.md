# ansible-project
Description:
- Designed and implemented a scalable CI/CD pipeline across four servers integrating Jenkins for continuous integration, Ansible for configuration management and automation, and Apache as the web server.
- Automated code deployment flow from GitHub repository to production environment with secure SSH communication between Jenkins, Ansible, and web servers.
- Configured Jenkins to trigger builds and transfer code securely to Ansible server, which runs playbooks to deploy web content on the Apache server.
- Ensured robust root SSH access and security configurations for seamless automation.
- Resulted in faster deployment cycles, reduced manual intervention, and improved release reliability.
